# Async Clipboard Project

This project, developed in TypeScript, introduces custom formats using the asynchronous Clipboard API, a powerful tool that enables web applications to read and write clipboard data.

## Features

- **Custom Formats**: We've developed our own custom formats, taking clipboard operations to the next level. With these formats, you can copy and paste data in a way that best suits your application's needs.

- **Pickling**: Our custom formats are implemented using a process known as pickling. Pickling allows us to serialize and de-serialize data, making it easy to store complex objects in the clipboard.

- **Asynchronous Clipboard API**: All operations are carried out using the async Clipboard API. This provides a seamless and efficient user experience, as clipboard operations do not block the main thread.
